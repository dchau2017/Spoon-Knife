### Project Ideas and Organization
Write about your thoughts on possible projects of interest and how you would like to organize it. Common repository? Blessed repository? Other?

I am interested in doing a project in the area of Web Development/Cloud Programming since I am interested in those topics after doing 
personal RCOS projects and classes at RPI. It would also be cool to do a project using Machine Learning or AI since I have never touched
those topics so far during my time at RPI. 

I would probably organize it using a common repository since I imagine only a small amount of people will be working at the project at a time.
Using a blessed repo would be good if we had alot more people or if we were working using strict agile methodologies. However, since we have
a small amout of people, common repo would be the best option since we don't have to worry that much about branches/merge housekeeping.
